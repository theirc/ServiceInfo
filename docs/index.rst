The `International Rescue Committee (IRC)`_, one of the world's leading
humanitarian organizations providing relief and resettlement services to people
impacted by crisis, created `ServiceInfo`_, an online platform that enables the
more than 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon to search and rate aid and
commercial services – ranging from healthcare to financial services and retail –
online or over the phone.

Developed by the IRC and funded by a grant from the U.S. Bureau of Population,
Refugees and Migration, the IRC's ServiceInfo project aims to provide a
solution to an information gap for transient refugees looking for local
services.

This is ServiceInfo's user and developer documentation. To explore other open
source IRC projects, please see IRC's `GitHub`_ account.
